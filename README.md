# RAG Experimental System

This project is an experimental **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that leverages language models to generate responses using both model knowledge and relevant provided context.  
The system is designed for flexibility, allowing you to modify the context and experiment with different API keys and models.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Enhances language model outputs using custom or external knowledge.
- **OpenRouter API Integration:** Easily switch or insert your own model API keys via environment variables.
- **Editable Context:** Manually edit or replace the context with your own data for tailored experiments.
- **Simple Setup:** Minimal requirements for quick experimentation.
